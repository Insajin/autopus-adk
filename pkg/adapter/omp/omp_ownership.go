// PruneRoots are the compiler-owned directories omp may delete stale
// manifest-recorded files from. It is the single source of truth for Update,
// Clean, and the `auto update` preview, which must agree: a preview that
// promises a prune the apply path cannot perform leaves orphaned files behind
// forever, because the manifest is rewritten either way and never proposes the
// prune again.
//
// Pruning is additionally limited to paths recorded in the previous manifest
// (see adapter.BuildManifestDiff and Clean), so a file omp never wrote is never
// eligible: antigravity's .agents/commands/*.toml survives because omp never
// records it, and so does every file under .omp/rules that lacks the
// ompRuleFilePrefix namespace — generated rules share that directory with the
// user's own rules, and only the prefixed files omp recorded are ever pruned.
//
// Eligibility is decided per surface, not per operation. .agents/commands stays
// listed even after omp yields the command surface, because opencode serves
// commands from .opencode/commands/ — nothing ever overwrites the .md files omp
// wrote under .agents/commands, so dropping the root would strand all of them.
// .agents/skills is the opposite case: OpenCode owns that shared surface in
// mixed installations, so OMP must yield it instead of pruning an in-place file.
// @AX:ANCHOR [AUTO]: Public prune-root contract shared by update, clean, preview, and manifest reconciliation.
// @AX:REASON [AUTO]: Removing or narrowing this function can orphan generated OMP surfaces or delete another platform's ownership.
