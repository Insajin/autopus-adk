// manifest, an empty sticky set, an unparseable stdin payload, an unusable state
// directory, or an off-cadence index — writes no stdout and no stderr. Per-rule
// benign absence — a body file that is simply gone — skips only that rule while
// every other sticky rule still injects. Per-rule fail-closed — a containment or
// size violation — suppresses only the offending rule and writes its name and
// reason code to stderr. An unresolvable project root is the caller's case: it
// is resolved before StickyFire is reached.
//

// exit code 2 on UserPromptSubmit erases the user's prompt, so no failure inside
// this runtime may reach the caller in a form it could turn into a non-zero exit.
