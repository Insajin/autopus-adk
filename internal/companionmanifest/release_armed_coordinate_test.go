// The armed coordinate has four sites, three of which cannot be derived.
//
//   - The release.yaml push tag trigger: GitHub Actions cannot construct triggers
//     dynamically, and release_contract_test forbids a `v*` wildcard so an
//     arbitrary tag cannot enter the protected release job.
//   - The Homebrew recovery workflow guard: workflow_dispatch has no tag filter,
//     so this comparison prevents recovery from rerunning against an old release.
//   - The release_tag in prepare-release.sh: this is the operator's armed site.
//
// The fourth site is data in the producer coordinate table. This test fails as
// soon as any of the four diverge, rather than after an immutable tag is pushed.
