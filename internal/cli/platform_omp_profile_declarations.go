// family from a provider string, so an undeclared model still fails closed.

// profile set declares: the selected profile's own candidates (including any
// pre-existing explicit root override) plus the built-in matrix of the selected
// profile name under every anchor family, so a cross-family pin such as
// anthropic/claude-fable-5-1 stays attestable while --family openai is active.
