// Observation-integrity promotion gate (SPEC-ADK-REVIEW-INTEGRITY-001).
//
// A multi-provider review can return PASS while a reviewer never actually saw a
// truncated auxiliary document, or while only a minority of providers responded.
// This file aggregates both signals into machine-readable degraded reasons and
// decides whether a clean PASS may auto-promote a SPEC to "approved". The render
// halves (verdict-line suffix, Observation Coverage section, override audit line)
// live in pkg/spec/review_persist.go; the enforcement logic stays here in the
// platform-neutral Go runtime.

// integrityRemedyHint is the operator remedy appended to the promotion-hold
// message when the gate blocks auto-promotion. It names both escape routes: fix
// the underlying observation gap, or re-run with the explicit override flag
// (REQ-RINT-PROMO-06).
